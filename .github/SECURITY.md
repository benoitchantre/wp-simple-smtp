# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**Version 1.3** release chain is in active support, and bug reports will be dealt with as a priority. **Development** or custom builds are **not supported**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any discovered vulnerabilities in the issues section of this project, with the tag 'security'. Security-related bugs are reviewed quicker than regular bugs. Pull requests to address vulnurabilities are very much welcome.

The 'security' tag may also be added or removed to reports at maintainer discretion.

## Fix Timeframes

All **bug reports relating to security exploits** will be dealt with as a matter of urgency, marked as top priority to maintainers and release managers. We cannot guarantee timeframes outside of **'ASAP'**.

Please be aware that this is a **community project**, and as such there is no premium-level bug resolution service. If you wish to have top-tier security support, I would recommend considering a premium plugin service such as **[WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/)**.
